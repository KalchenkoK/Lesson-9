                <p class="snow_text"> Modern snowboarding began in 1965 when Sherman Poppen, an engineer in Muskegon,
                    Michigan, invented a toy
                    for his daughters by fastening two skis together and attaching a rope to one end so he would have
                    some
                    control as they stood on the board and glided downhill. </p>
                <p class="snow_text"> Dubbed the "snurfer" (combining snow and
                    surfer)
                    by his wife Nancy, the toy proved so popular among his daughters' friends that Poppen licensed the
                    idea
                    to a manufacturer, Brunswick Corporation, that sold about a million snurfers over the next decade.
                    And,
                    in 1966 alone, over half a million snurfers were sold.</p>

                <p class="snow_text"> English billiards, called simply billiards in the United Kingdom,[a] where it
                    originated, and in many former British colonies such as Australia, is a cue sport that combines the
                    aspects of carom billiards and pool. Two cue balls (historically both white, with one marked with a
                    dot,
                    but more recently one white and one yellow) and a red object ball are used.</p>
                <p class="snow_text"> Each player or team uses
                    a
                    different cue ball. It is played on a billiards table with the same dimensions as a snooker table
                    and
                    points are scored for cannons and pocketing the balls. English billiards has also, but less
                    frequently,
                    been referred to as "the English game", "the all-in game" and (formerly) "the common game".</p>

                <h2 class="snow">Alcohol</h2>
                <p class="snow_text">The inflammable nature of the exhalations of wine was already known to ancient
                    natural
                    philosophers such as Aristotle (384–322 BCE), Theophrastus (c. 371–287 BCE), and Pliny the Elder
                    (23/24–79 CE). However, this did not immediately lead to the isolation of alcohol, even despite
                    the
                    development of more advanced distillation techniques in second- and third-century Roman Egypt. An
                    important recognition, first found in one of the writings attributed to Jābir ibn Ḥayyān (ninth
                    century
                    CE), was that by adding salt to boiling wine, which increases the wine's relative volatility, the
                    flammability of the resulting vapors may be enhanced. The distillation of wine is attested in
                    Arabic
                    works attributed to al-Kindī (c. 801–873 CE) and to al-Fārābī (c. 872–950), and in the 28th book of
                    al-Zahrāwī's (Latin: Abulcasis, 936–1013) Kitāb al-Taṣrīf (later translated into Latin as Liber
                    servatoris). In the twelfth century, recipes for the production of aqua ardens ("burning water",
                    i.e., alcohol) by distilling wine with salt started to appear in a number of Latin works, and by the
                    end
                    of the thirteenth century it had become a widely known substance among Western European chemists.

                <h2 class="snow snow_it">IT</h2>
                <p class="snow_text">Information technology (IT) is the use of computers to store or retrieve data
                    and information. IT is typically used within the context of business operations as opposed to
                    personal or entertainment technologies. IT is considered to be a subset of information and
                    communications technology (ICT). An information technology system (IT system) is generally an
                    information system, a communications system, or, more specifically speaking, a computer system –
                    including all hardware, software, and peripheral equipment – operated by a limited group of IT
                    users.

                    Humans have been storing, retrieving, manipulating, and communicating information since the
                    Sumerians in Mesopotamia developed writing in about 3000 BC. However, the term information
                    technology in its modern sense first appeared in a 1958 article published in the Harvard Business
                    Review; authors Harold J. Leavitt and Thomas L. Whisler commented that "the new technology does not
                    yet have a single established name. We shall call it information technology (IT)." </p>
